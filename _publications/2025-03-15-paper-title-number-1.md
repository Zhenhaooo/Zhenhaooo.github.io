Decision-making in long-tail scenarios is crucial to autonomous driving development, with realistic and challenging simulations playing a pivotal role in testing safety-critical situations. However, the current open-source datasets do not systematically include long-tail distributed scenario data, making acquiring such scenarios a formidable task. To address this problem, a data mining framework is proposed, which performs in-depth analysis on two widely-used datasets, NGSIM and INTERACTION, to pinpoint data with hazardous behavioral traits, aiming to bridge the gap in these overlooked scenarios. The approach utilizes Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) based on an enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model, integrated with the vehicle's environmental analysis, to iteratively refine and represent the newly generated vehicle trajectory. Innovatively, the solution optimizes the generation of adversarial scenario data from the perspectives of sensitivity and reasonable adversarial. It is demonstrated through experiments that, compared to the unfiltered data and baseline models, the approach exhibits more adversarial yet natural behavior regarding collision rate, acceleration, and lane changes, thereby validating its suitability for generating scenario data and providing constructive insights for the development of future scenarios and subsequent decision training.
